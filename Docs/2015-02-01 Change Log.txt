2015-02-01 FlightStab Change Log


2015-02-01 FlightStab.ino 
Add #define RX_WIDTH_MODE_MID 1550
This new value will be used to move gain input hysteresis to reside entirelly in 
the Hold Mode Range. This forces Rate Mode for any value below 1525 which 
insures resetting any Hold Mode corrections when gain is set to 0.

SerialRX.ino
Use #define for mid channel value instead of hard coded 1520

Made changes to FlightStab.h for added MIXER_EPA Mode for 900-2100us
and new wing mode RUD 2-ELE 2-AIL

Made changes to FlightStab.ino to support the new MIXER_EPA Mode and new wing 
mode.  

New wing mode required increasing the size of arrays mix_out_low_limit, 
mix_out_high_limit and zero_correction.  

Size of pout2[] in apply_mixer() also increased to allow tracking of flap 
channel limits as flp_out2 is used for second elevator.  Size of loop applying 
limits is now dyanmic to allow flap channel to act as unconstrained pass through 
when not being used for second elevator.

Removed build option for MAX_TRAVEL as new MIXER_EPA eliminates the need.
